            The current version of all Luma mods (based on latest commit).
            
            Installation instructions:
            - Extract all the files directly in the game main executable folder (replace the previous ones if you are updating)
            - If you already had a ReShade installation (dxgi.dll) overwrite it unless it's the same version. If you have other mods that used the dxgi.dll file, find a way to proxy them
            - Boot the game
            - Press home to bring out the ReShade and Luma menus (if they don't appear, ReShade or Luma failed to install or run)
            - Customize the settings if you'd like, the defaults are already good and pick up on your display calibration

            Note that not all mods here are playable, some are work in progress. Consult the wiki mod list for their state, or ask in "HDR Den" discord for more information.
            Note that some mods here might not be complete, like "Prey", which misses (optional) data for the rest of the mod, these should be downloaded from Nexus.
            "Test" mods are made to be tested and have tools to investigate what's going on, and help the developers gather information.
            The "Generic" mod will work in many games out of the box, especially if you pair it with a separate Auto HDR upgrade method.
            Proton should be fully compatible out of the box.
