// Specify a define with the name of the game here (GAME_*).
// This is optional but can be used to hardcode custom (per game) behaviours in the core library,
// or other reasons. We can't automate it through the project define system (based on the project name) because
// we need these defines to be upper case and space free.
#define GAME_TEMPLATE 1

// Define all the global "core" defines before including its files:
// Enable these to be able to use DLSS's or FSR's code
#define ENABLE_NGX 0
#define ENABLE_FIDELITY_SK 0
#define GEOMETRY_SHADER_SUPPORT 0

// Instead of "manually" including the "core" library, we simply include its main code file (which is a header).
// The library in itself is standalone, as in, it compiles fine and could directly be used as a template addon etc if built as dll but,
// there's a major limitation in how libraries dependencies work by nature, and that is that you can only make
// one version of them for all other projects to use. For performance and tidiness reasons, we are interested in
// having global defines that can be turned on and off per game, as opposed to runtime (static) parameters.
// Hence why we specify the global defines before including the core Luma file (where near all of the generic Luma implementation is).
// If we wanted to use a library, we'd also need to add a core "main" definition in a cpp file, to link it properly.
// All externs that are currently defined in core would also need to be manually defined in each game's implementation (e.g. see "RESHADE_EXTERNS" above).
// The only disadvantage of not actually including the core as a library, is that we'll have to add the same include/library dependencies in our
// game project (e.g. add ReShade, DLSS, etc), and manually add all cpp files too.
//
// To compile in different modes (e.g. "DEVELOPMENT", "TEST" etc see "global_defines.h").
